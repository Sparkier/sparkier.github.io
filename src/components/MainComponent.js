            My research is on visualization and explainability for neural
            networks.
            In this context, I am always interested in new methods to better
            understand neural networks.
            I try to help developers in this area with techniques that helps
            them communicate and develop new approaches.
            For consumers of AI-powered applications, I work on visualizations
            that help them understand the decision that these algorithms make.
