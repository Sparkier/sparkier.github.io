    I am a Ph. D. student at Ulm University. When I am not in front of my
    computer, you will probably find me in the mountains.

    My research is on visualization and explainability for neural networks. In
    this context, I am always interested in new methods to better understand
    artificial intelligence. I try to help developers in this area with
    techniques that help them communicate and develop new approaches. For
    consumers of AI-powered applications, I work on visualizations that help
    them understand the decision that these algorithms make. If you are
    interested in my research, check out my scholar account.
