  <h1>Alex BÃ¤uerle</h1>
  <p>
    I am a Research Scientist at Sigma Computing. Previously, I did my Ph. D. at
    Ulm University. When I am not in front of my computer, you will probably
    find me in the mountains.

    My research is on visualization and explainability for neural networks. In
    this context, I am always interested in new methods to better understand
    artificial intelligence. I try to help developers with techniques and
    visualizations that foster communication and provide insights during
    development. For consumers of AI-powered applications, I work on
    visualizations that help them understand the decisions that these algorithms
    make.
