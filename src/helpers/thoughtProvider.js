        '<p>To get this post going, let us first set the scene for our post-apocalyptic scenario (we will later dive into if that would really be <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/postapocalyptic">post-apocalyptic</a>). For now, let us assume a state that is relatively similar to the situation in most countries. That is, we can still leave our houses and go grocery shopping or to doctors, but all non-necessary contacts are to be prevented (because of some form of a virus).</p><p>Right now, the most important thing seems to be the economy (maybe not only right now). There is a lot of discussion around how the current situation impacts the economy and while everyone might agree that the pandemic currently hurts economic growth, there has never been a time when we did not find a way around such issues. What I am trying to say with this is, that while short-term implications might be severe and cause problems for many employees as well as employers, this is not a permanent state. While the economy needs to transform for sure (e.g., we probably won\'t need transportation as much anymore if we can\'t go anywhere, while communication gets even more important). So my take on this is that we will always have something to do and that the economy forcefully changing is nothing that will be a major hit for the human race in the long term (on the contrary, I think if we keep doing things as we do right now, that will be a problem). I don\'t think there would be a societal collapse or anything in that direction because of economic reasons, at least considering the current limitations on our lives.</p><p>I think more of a difference will be how we live our social lives and how we spend our free time. Currently, with this pandemic coming up to its first birthday, we are still accepting that life is basically work and then tv/games/sofa for the rest of the day. However, while a year might be acceptable for this, our emotional well-being will demand more. Again, I take an optimistic view here, though. Such problems can spark innovation, which might result in new ways to communicate and socialize. If we think about getting to know new colleagues or finding friends, this is very hard right now. However, I think that technology could help mitigate these problems, and maybe in the future further remove geographical borders. If digital is the only way to find friends, socialize, or get a job in the future, this might well mitigate bias, and make everything more accessible. We would no longer be limited to find social contacts in our proximity, which might create more interesting connections, and lead to social interactions that match our interest much more. How this needed technological transformation goes is highly speculative. Maybe this will be the final push to AR and VR, and telepresence will be the new social life. Maybe future generations will not complain about real-life social interaction and are fine with not meeting new people in person. Maybe, the visual appearance of an individual will be less of a deciding factor for social contacts in such a future.</p><p>All in all, you see that even though we go through a very hard time emotionally and socially right now, I think that we are flexible enough to accept, make the most of, and even strive even in such situations. I think what this pandemic has shown us, is that there is more we can handle than we sometimes think. We would never have thought to be able to basically live in isolation for more than a year. I hope this is an indication of more problems that we can overcome in the future, and that, when push comes to shove, we can bear a lot more than we think. Maybe this mindset of not needing all that we thought before this pandemic can lead us to make better decisions for our future, and act on threats such as climate change faster and more rigorously, knowing that we can handle the immediate problems that any intervention can bring.</p>'),

        'We still consume lectures like we ' +
    'always did. Everyone comes to the classroom, and one person is standing ' +
    'in front to educate everyone. In this post, I elaborate on how I think ' +

        '<p>If you look up the term <i>lecture</i> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecture#History">Wikipedia</a>, you will find that even in medieval universities, instructors read to classes of students. While this form of reading might have been altered by projecting leture notes including images, videos, and other rich content, and the way in which lecturers are prepared and educated to do their job has significantly improved, the main setting has stayed the same. We are still mostly listening to a person talking in the front of a crowd. Reciting mostly insights that other have made and published.<br>While recently, platforms for online courses, such as <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>, as well as the ambivalence of YouTube tutorials have come to existence, our education systems have mostly ignored this trend. However, through such channels, we could learn from the absolute experts on their fields, getting explanations about novel approaches from their inventors, and take advantage of highly polished courses from masters in education communication. At the same time, our schools and universities each have their own lecturers, who have to prepare their own course material, all putting a dent in the time they can spend helping students directly and personally.<br>That being said, I am not arguing for reducing the number of educators in these systems, nor am I debating their justificatoin in the first place. If anything, I think ressources spend on education are one of the most well-spent. However, what I am saying is that the current approach to education is lacking behind the state of our technology. The time of lecturers could spend way more effectively not preparing and reciting their individual course material in every school and university, but to look at the pool of existing resources, compile a curriculum consisting of the best lectures ever held, and taking the time that was saved during the process to answer questions of their sudents, help them solving their problems and excercises, and being there for them as mentors, not as mere information channels. Professors at universities could take a similar approach, while at the same time saving capacity for novel and exciting research.<br>I, thus, argue that our system of education is outdated, and that we could be much more efficient, while making everyone happier and more productive in the process. This could be done by taking course material and lectures from a set of well produced resources and compiling these resources to every students individual needs and interests. Students could learn from the best inventors, innovators, and lecturers, while being supported in person by well trained pedagogues.<br>I have been wrestling with this thought throughout a global pandemic, so I am definetly not the only person thinking about this. Nonetheless, I think this does not get enough attention. If you have your own thoghts on this, or just want do discuss, I am happy to chat.</p>'),
