		I am currently a Research Scientist at Google, exploring the right interface between humans and
		AI. Previously, I was a Founding Member of Technical Staff at Axiom, where we built ML for drug
		toxicity prediction, and a Postdoctoral Researcher at Carnegie Mellon University working on AI
		evaluation and prompt engineering. I completed my Ph.D. at Ulm University. When I am not in
		front of my computer, you will probably find me in the mountains.

	<p class="text-center">
		My research is at the intersection of AI and HCI. I prototype and try to understand novel modes
		of interaction with AI, focusing on interfaces that help humans be creative with AI systems.
