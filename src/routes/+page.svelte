		I am currently a Researcher at CMU working on AI developer tools. Previously, I was a Research
		Scientist at Sigma Computing. I did my Ph. D. at Ulm University. When I am not in front of my
		computer, you will probably find me in the mountains.

	<p class="text-center">
		My research is at the intersection of AI and HCI. In this context, I am always searching for the
		best method to connect humans with AI systems. I try to help developers with techniques that
		foster communication, use visualiztions to provide insights during development, and work on
		epxlanations that help them understand the decisions their AI systems make.
