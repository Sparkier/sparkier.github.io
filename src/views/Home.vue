        I am a Ph. D. student at Ulm University. When I am not in front of my
        computer, you will probably find me in the mountains.

        My research is on visualization and explainability for neural
        networks. In this context, I am always interested in new methods to
        better understand artificial intelligence. I try to help developers in
        this area with techniques that help them communicate and develop new
        approaches. For consumers of AI-powered applications, I work on
        visualizations that help them understand the decision that these
        algorithms make. If you are interested in my research, check out my
        scholar account.
