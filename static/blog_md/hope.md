It can be hard these days to stay positive. There are a bunch of things that keep dragging me down, and I imagine some of you feel the same way. The thing that's bothering me the most (and I'm sure some of you feel the same way) is the current political landscape. I will briefly outline some of the crazieness that happened in the last few weeks, but I'll then focus on how I get myself back in positive mindset.

## Politics of Hate

The current political landscape is, frankly, depressing. All over the world, we see policiticans who choose to polarize, divide, manipulate, and blatantly lie to their citizens. I'm going to ground this in what I see in the US and Germany because this is what I'm most familiar with, but similar things are happening in many other countries<sup><a id="ref1" href="#note1">[1]</a></sup>. My main problem here is that politicians make use of the fact that it is easier to polarize than to unite, it is easier to manipulate than to inform, and it is easier to make it sound like there are simple solutions to complex problems than to the hard, long-term work.

I'm going to start with an example a lot of you might not be as familiar with, because it's happening in Germany. The far-right political party AfD (Alternative for Germany) has been gaining a lot of popularity in recent years<sup><a id="ref2" href="#note2">[2]</a></sup>. For a long time, there was a consensus among the other political parties that there will be absolutely no collaboration with the AfD, to the point where parties would not put up policies to vote on that would only get accepted with the support of the AfD (called _Brandmauer_ or _firewall_ in English<sup><a id="ref3" href="#note3">[3]</a></sup>). After two incidents with a total of 8 deaths<sup><a id="ref4" href="#note4">[4]</a></sup>, the party that will (barring a huge upset) win today's election entered a proposal against immigrants into the Bundestag<sup><a id="ref5" href="#note5">[5]</a></sup> that is likely illegal under both German and European law<sup><a id="ref6" href="#note6">[6]</a></sup>. All because those 8 deaths were caused by two immigrants, a community that is in many other ways integral to the success of the country. Those deaths are terrible, avoidable, and unnecessary, but there are also over 2,500 traffic deaths in Germany each year<sup><a id="ref7" href="#note7">[7]</a></sup> and somehow the same party does not vote for speed limits even though evidence shows they'd be effective (not even just in reducing traffic deaths, but also in reducing greenhouse gas emissions<sup><a id="ref8" href="#note8">[8]</a></sup>). They knew the proposal would only pass with the support of the AfD. As a person who is not a citizen of the country they live in, this is deeply unsettling to me. Sorry Germany, but you're the wrong country to give right-wing populists a stage. Just two days ago, _Germany's John Oliver_, Jan BÃ¶hmermann, had an opinion piece in the New York Times<sup><a id="ref9" href="#note9">[18]</a></sup> that summarizes the reasons for concern very well (highly recommend watching!).

At the same itme, we see a shift towards unfounded claims, aggression, and outright lies from the US president. This ranges form going against long-fought-for rights around diversity and inclusion<sup><a id="ref10" href="#note10">[10]</a></sup> (again, with unfounded claims<sup><a id="ref11" href="#note11">[11]</a></sup>) to aggression towards multiple countries<sup><a id="ref12" href="#note12">[12]</a></sup>. It is baffeling to me that the US president is doing things like claiming new names for geographic regions<sup><a id="ref13" href="#note13">[13]</a></sup> (I hope you see the irony of renaming a body of water in a government claims to be all about efficiency<sup><a id="ref14" href="#note14">[14]</a></sup>) and openly thinking about expanding US territory even if that would require military action<sup><a id="ref15" href="#note15">[15]</a></sup>. Just this week, the US president falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war<sup><a id="ref16" href="#note16">[16]</a></sup>. Honestly, this really scares me and goes against everything the US stood for for a long time, where freedom and democracy for all people was the main focus. It enters the US into a very similar path that they have long critizied other countries for, e.g., Russia and China.

## Microdoses of Happiness

With all of this chaos, disinformation, and hate, I think it is important to remind yourself how great it is to see acts of kindness, togetherness, and love. And that is why I will follow up with some examples of what makes me happy. Things like this can be observed every day, some move us very deeply, and we should try to spread and multiply them.

### Uniting against Racism

A great video to watch if you think you're losing hope are the football (the one that's actually played with feet) fans of Stuttgart starting a chant against nazis. In this video, the whole stadium is asked to be quiet for a minute of silence for the victims of the christmas market attack in Magdeburg<sup><a id="ref4" href="#note4">[4]</a></sup>. Then, an idiot begins paroling a chant against immigrants (_germany for the germans_). The whole stadium immediately starts talking over him, culminating in a collective chant of _Nazis out!_. Please watch the video<sup><a id="ref17" href="#note17">[17]</a></sup>, this one will go under your skin.

### Admiring great Art

I started going to the SFMOMA regularly. They have free first Thursdays each month for SF residents and I've been trying to go every time I'm in town. They have a lot of great and ever-changing exhibitions, but the one that moved me most deeply was a video installation by Ragnar Kjartansson called _The Visitors_. There is a short snippet of it on YouTube<sup><a id="ref18" href="#note18">[18]</a></sup>, but I highly recommend going there in person and watching the whole thing (it's about an hour long). The top voted comment on YouTube is literally _Please please please NEVER TAKE THIS VIDEO DOWN! I saw this work live, and it is absolutely incredible. Sitting there live for the whole hour to see the plot unfold was one of the most surreal experiences of my entire life!_. There are multiple projections onto all walls of a pretty big room, all show different rooms in a mansion where people play musical instruments and sing. Together, they form a beautiful musical piece. However, the main reason why YouTube probably can't transport the experience is the atmosphere in the room when you see it live in the museum. People will start sitting on the floor, some closing their eyes, and just listen. Some will slowly walk around the room and look at each of the projectiond and musicians in detail. Couples will start hugging or holding hands. It's a really beautiful experience.

Another great piece of art in a completely different medium is the game _Outer Wilds_. It's a masterpiece that I deeply enjoyed even though I did not even play it myself! I won't spoil anything more than saying the game is about curiosity, exploration, and what it means to be part of something bigger than yourself. It creates genuine moments of awe and discovery and manages to be both deeply melancholic and incredibly hopeful at the same time. You really have to discover things yourself, but I can only recommend playing it<sup><a id="ref19" href="#note19">[19]</a></sup> or watching a playthrough<sup><a id="ref20" href="#note20">[20]</a></sup> (I watched this one, the player cries multiple times, it's just beautiful to watch).

### Experiencing the light-heartedness of a Child

This is one that I'm sure everyone has seen before. For me, seeing children having fun without thinking about anything else is one of the most beautiful things in the world. It's incredibly pure and innocent, and it's hard not to smile when watching it. To give you and example of what I mean, I'll link another video<sup><a id="ref21" href="#note21">[21]</a></sup>. This is a boy named Jacob telling his mom that he asked someone to be his _Valentimes_. It's just too cute not to put a smile on your face.

### Seeking Joy in Real Life

The above all focused on things that I can share (at least to some extent). However, I hope these exampels for microdoses of happiness inspire you to look for joy in your everyday life. This can be anything, e.g., a really well-crafted cup of coffee (or in my case, hot chocolate), a good conversation with a friend, going to an art gallery, or engaging in the public discourse and making sure your opinion is heard, such as through politics, demonstrations, or voting.

## How does all of this help?

While much in this world can be depressing and overwhelming, small acts of kindness and joy (even if it's just a stupid blogpost that nobody will read) can help you not give up and in turn make it more likely that things will get better. We might be at the brink of the biggest technical revolution in human history and we just have to get this right. Hence, try to embrace and spread love and joy whenever you can. I strongly believe that rational, non-extremist minds are still in the majority, and if we stand together what unites is still stronger than what divides.

Thus, never lose your hope, optimism, and joy, for if we work together and not against each other, utopia is still more likely than dystopia.
