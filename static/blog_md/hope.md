It can be hard these days to stay positive. There are a bunch of things that keep dragging me down, and I imagine some of you feel the same way. I'll go into details for one of these topics, but I'll end this post with a message of hope. This is mostly a post to organize my thoughts and stay positive myself, but I hope it can also help you to stay positive.

## Politics of hate

The current political landscape is, frankly, depressing. All over the world, we see policiticans who choose to polarize, divide, manipulate, and blatantly lie to their citizens. I'm going to ground this in what I see in the US and Germany because this is what I'm most familiar with, but similar things are happening in many other countries<sup><a id="ref1" href="#note1">[1]</a></sup>. My main problem here is that politicians make use of the fact that it is easier to polarize than to unite, it is easier to manipulate than to inform, and it is easier to make it sound like there are simple solutions to complex problems than to work on hard long-term solutions.

I'm going to start with an example a lot of you might not be as familiar with, because it's happening in Germany. The far-right political party AfD (Alternative for Germany) has been gaining a lot of popularity in the last years<sup><a id="ref2" href="#note2">[2]</a></sup>. For a long time, there was a consensus among the other political parties that there will be absolutely no collaboration with the AfD, to the point where parties would not put up policies to vote on that would only get accepted with the support of the AfD (called "Brandmauer" or "firewall" in English<sup><a id="ref3" href="#note3">[3]</a></sup>). After two incidents with a total of 8 deaths<sup><a id="ref4" href="#note4">[4]</a></sup>, the party that will most likely win the next election put a proposal against immigrants to the Bundestag<sup><a id="ref5" href="#note5">[5]</a></sup> that is likely illegal under both German and European law<sup><a id="ref6" href="#note6">[6]</a></sup>. All because those 8 deaths were caused by two members of a community of immigrants that is in many other ways integral to the success of the country. Those deaths are terrible, avoidable, and unnecessary, but there are also over 2,500 traffic deaths in Germany each year<sup><a id="ref7" href="#note7">[7]</a></sup> and somehow the same party does not vote for speed limits even though evidence shows they'd be effective (not even just in reducing traffic deaths, but also in reducing greenhouse gas emissions<sup><a id="ref8" href="#note8">[8]</a></sup>). They knew the proposal would only pass with the support of the AfD. As a person who is not a citizen of the country they live in, this is deeply unsettling to me. Sorry Germany, but you're the wrong country to give right-wing populists a stage.

Somewhat similarly, we see a shift towards unfounded claims and outright aggression from the US president. This ranges form going against long-fought-for rights around diversity and inclusion<sup><a id="ref9" href="#note9">[9]</a></sup> (again, with unfounded claims<sup><a id="ref10" href="#note10">[10]</a></sup>) to outright aggression towards multiple countries<sup><a id="ref11" href="#note11">[11]</a></sup>. It is baffeling to me that the US president is doing things like claiming new names for geographic regions<sup><a id="ref12" href="#note12">[12]</a></sup> (I hope you see the irony of renaming a body of water in a government claims to be all about efficiency<sup><a id="ref13" href="#note13">[13]</a></sup>) and openly thinking about expanding US territory even if that would require military action<sup><a id="ref14" href="#note14">[14]</a></sup>. Honestly, this really scares me and goes against everything the US stood for for a long time, where freedom and democracy for all people was the main focus. It enters the US into a very similar path that they have long critizied other countries for, e.g., Russia and China. If some of what the US president is alluding at would actually be turned into action, it would be a very dark time for the US and the world.

<!-- ## AI and its power

I'm not an AI doomer, but I do think that any powerful technology (arguably, this could be the most powerful technology ever) can be used for good and bad. Therefore, I'm absolutely not a fan of individual people or organizations controlling it. Whenever that happens, it is very likely that it will be used to dominate and control others for personal gain. This could mean everything from losing one's meaning in life, to technological warfare. Some people think that AI might completely change the way our lives work (even though I don't agree with some of their conclusions). However, currently a lot of the large players advocate for regulations that would benefit them and hurt others, such as the open-souce community. If this trend continues, and modern oligarchs get their way, I'm not very optimistic about how AI will be used (oligarchs historically don't have the best track record).

If we ever get to something like AGI, we need to make absolutely sure that everyone benefits from it in the same way. If that happens, it will be the most transformative technology in human history. AI will bring the potential to solve many other problems some of which are discusesd in here (wink wink climate change).

## Climate change

We've been moving in the right direction for a while now, but recently we took a turn for the worse. This turn is closely related to the two points mentioned above, where AI and technology development seems to be prioritized over everything else as it could have outsized economical impact and politicians are either forced or inclined to choose short-term gains over long-term solutions. This reflects, e.g., the US president's recent actions around renewable energy. There are lots of technology and policy solutions that could be implemented to mitigate the worst effects of climate change, but we're moving very slow on both fronts.

I think the most important factor here is that with everything going on in the world, we have lost a lot of focus on the climate crisis. We're not doing enough to bring this back to the top of the political agenda. In turn, politicians focus on other issues that they can propose seemingly easy "solutions" for. If we focused more on the climate crisis again, we wouldn't only be ablet to mitigate the worst effects of climate change, but we would also remove attention from other issues that are designed to polarize and divide, but we're not currently doing enough of that. -->

## Why we should not give up

While all of this can be very depressing, working together to make things better is still the only way forward. We are at the brink of the biggest technical revolution in human history with AI and things can tip either way on so many issues. However, if we stand together and try question things, we're still in the majority and stronger than the forces that want to divide us.

Therefore, the next time you feel like giving up, remember that giving up could be the end of this story, and if we only work togehter to make things better in small ways every day, we can still make a difference. I really want to live in a diverse world where people can pursue their own interests and passions, where our planet is healthy and sustainable, where we can live in peace and harmony with each other, and where technology is used for good. Examples of this happen every day, some of them move me very deeply, and we should try to spread and multiply them. Some good things to look into when you think you're losing hope are the (european) football fans of Stuttgart starting a chant against nazis when a nazi begins paroling during a minute of silence (please watch the video<sup><a id="ref15" href="#note15">[15]</a></sup> and try not to cry), the open-source community coming together to democratize AI<sup><a id="ref16" href="#note16">[16]</a></sup>, or the people protesting for climate action<sup><a id="ref17" href="#note17">[17]</a></sup>.

Thus, never lose hope, for if we work together and not against each other, I am convinced that utopia is still more likely than dystopia.
